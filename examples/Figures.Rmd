	\caption[Examples of samples drawn according to different sampling schemes.]{Examples of samples drawn according to different sampling schemes, including A) adaptive cluster sampling (ACS), B) restricted ACS (RACS), and C) and D), simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR).
For ACS and RACS (A and B), the presence of cacti (condition $C=1$) initiates adaptive cluster sampling, and in the primary sample $n_1 =$
`r dim(ACS_RACS_example_ACS[ACS_RACS_example_ACS$Sampling=="Primary Sample",])[1]`
only
`r dim(ACS_RACS_example_ACS[ACS_RACS_example_ACS$Sampling=="Primary Sample" & ACS_RACS_example_ACS$Cactus=="1",])[1]`
units contain the species of interest. In unrestricted ACS (A), an additional 
`r dim(ACS_RACS_example_ACS[ACS_RACS_example_ACS$Sampling!="Primary Sample",])[1]`
units are selected in the secondary sample and the sizes of the networks containing the species of interest are known (size of the largest network, $m = 
`r max(ACS_RACS_example_ACS$m)`$).
Three of the six networks of cacti are sampled.
However, in the RACS example (B; $q=12$ and $f_{\text{max}}=2$), only an additional
`r dim(ACS_RACS_example_RACS[ACS_RACS_example_RACS$Sampling!="Primary Sample",])[1]`
units are selected in the secondary sample and $m$ is known only for one (the top right neighborhood/network) of the four networks.
Two neighborhoods are sampled from the same network, both incorrectly estimating $m$ of that network.
The SRSWOR examples (C, n = 196, and D, n = 45) display the same final sample sizes as the ACS (A) and RACS (B) designs, respectively.
For both SRSWOR examples, a smaller fraction of the units sampled contain cacti compared to ACS and RACS, respectively.}
